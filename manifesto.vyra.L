What is .L?

.L is not just a file type. It is a contract of trust.
Every .L file represents a creation that was built using VYRA’s free platform,
tools, and support — and enters into a live, ethical agreement.

When this file becomes Live (i.e., monetized), a percentage of its revenue
is shared with the VYRA platform, respecting our value exchange model.

The .L principle:
- Create freely
- Grow safely
- Launch consciously
- Pay only when value is generated
